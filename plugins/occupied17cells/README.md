# occupied17cells.user.js

IITC Layer plugin which highlights the L17 cells which very likely already contain a Pokéstop or Gym.
When submitting new portal candidates in Ingress, and you want them to become Pokémon locations, you should look for candidates in the non-highlighted areas.
This plugin uses copied S2 code from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrunazo/l17cells/master/l17cells.user.js">117 cells plugin</a> made by vibrunazo for drawing the cells.

In combination with the <a href="https://github.com/Wintervorst/iitc/raw/master/plugins/occupied17cells">submitrange</a> plugin (to minimize 'too close mails')<br/>
