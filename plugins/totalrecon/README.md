What to do to create your own Portal Recon sheet and be able to share it with others.

Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/
Start a new, blank, spreadsheet

Go to ‘Tools’ -> ‘Script editor’

Remove content in Code.gs and paste the content from this Code.gs file

Select the ‘initialSetup’ function

Click the ‘play’ button to run

A dialogue pops up, choose ‘review permissions’

Choose the appropriate google account

Choose advanced

Go to ‘Untitled project’

Choose your Google+ account and ‘Allow’

The initialsetup will be run and the sheet will be prepared with the proper columns and column settings

Go back to script and choose ‘Publish’->’Deploy as WebApp’

Set ‘Who has access to the app” to Anyone even anonymous.

And choose ‘Deploy’

Copy the ‘Current web app URL’. You will be needing it later on.

Install the userscript. On first launch you will be prompted to enter this URL.

You will need to share this URL with all people and/or devices who will share the same set of data.

Enable the ‘Highlighter’ and when you click on the map it will display the input fields for storing your data. Set another highlighter and the popup will no longer be shown when clicking randomly on the map. However if you click on an existing marker, you can edit it and submit the changes.

You will see that all input and changes will be stored in your google sheet. You can share the sheet with whomever you like, or keep it to yourself. Removing markers is a matter of removing a row from the sheet.

You can toggle several layers on and off in the layer menu.

To refresh the markerset you can either refresh your browser or select the highlighter ‘Total Recon – Refresh data’. This might be especially useful on mobile IITC.
