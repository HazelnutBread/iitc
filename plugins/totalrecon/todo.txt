- Better layermanagement as used in the other plugins
- Rename 'candidate' to 'potential' and 'candidates' to 'potentials'
- Add imageurls for submitted candidates
- Draw image of submitted candidate. When editing. And for desktop on marker:hover
- Autorefresh (every minute) mechanism for 'direct' synchronization between multiple devices and users (performance impact hit?)
   Compare timestamps of objects and update accordingly?
- Store layerreference instead of layer + marker combination for handling updates
- Write manual so people can use this plugin without my assistence
