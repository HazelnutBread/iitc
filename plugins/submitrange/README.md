# submitrange.user.js
I have created this <a href="https://iitc.me/">IITC</a> plugin to highlights the 20 meter radius of existing portals on the Intel map.<br/>

After numerous ‘too close to an existing portal’ e-mails, I have decided to analyze them and combined with earlier research and assumptions throughout the web that a safe margin is to find and submit candidates at least with a 20 meter distance from existing portals.
Assumption/suggestion: Find and submit candidates in the non-highlighted part of the map and you should be okay.

Without you even using it for submitting new candidates you can try it out and confirm this theory by installing the plugin and opening the blue link in your ‘too close to existing portal’ e-mails.<br/>

It will open up your Intel and if the submit range plugin is enabled it should draw a marker on the place where you’ve submitted the portal candidate. If it is inside the purple area it was actually ‘too close’, if not, it may disprove this theory.

Of course, there are cases of portals which are placed within 20 meters of each other and did not result in ‘too close’ responses, but as another theory goes is that that may be because portals which have been moved, or are sponsored locations are not factored in when determining if a portal candidate is considered ‘too close’ to another. Or plainly, they just may be the exception to the rule.

Hopefully this helps you/us be more successful in creating new portals for the Ingress community.

Disclaimer: Portal location edits by OPR and portals in range coming live before your candidate, which weren’t at the time and something of a limit per L19 cell may still result in ‘too close’.
