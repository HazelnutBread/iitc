# Extensions for <a href="https://iitc.me/">IITC</a> - Ingress Intel map

# * See installation requirements below

I have created several user scripts to help players be more effective in submitting new candidates for portals, pokéstops or pokégyms.

# For both Ingress & Pokémon players
## <a href="https://github.com/Wintervorst/iitc/tree/master/plugins/submitrange">Submitrange</a>
Displays a 20 meter radius for existing portals, to prevent you from getting 'too close' e-mails. Search and find candidates in the non-highlighted area and you should be good. (excluding OPR location corrections or other candidates coming live before your submit) <br/>

# For Ingress players
## <a href="https://github.com/Wintervorst/iitc/tree/master/plugins/occupied19cells">Full Ingress cells</a>
Aside from the 20 meter radius, the maximum limit of portals in a L19 cell is one. This plugin highlight L19 cells which already contain a portal. As with the submitrange plugin. Search and find candidates outside of the highlighted area and you have a better chance of it ever becoming a portal.

# For Pokémon players
## <a href="https://github.com/Wintervorst/iitc/tree/master/plugins/occupied17cells">Full Pokémon cells</a>
Aside from the 20 meter radius, the maximum limit of stops/gyms in a L17 cell is 1. This plugin highlight L17 cells which already contain at least 1 portal (portals are converted to stops and gyms with a max of 1 per L17 cell). As with the submitrange plugin. Search and find candidates outside of the highlighted area and you have a better chance of it ever becoming a stop or gym in Pokémon.

## <a href="https://github.com/Wintervorst/iitc/tree/master/plugins/gympossible">Gympossible cells</a>
Highlights level 14 cells which are 1 stop short of having an additional gym. By smartly submitting new candidates you can focus on these cells to improve the rate of gyms in your area.
